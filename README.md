# Global Trends in CO2 Emissions from Industrial Combustion (Energy)

This repository explores global trends in **carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial combustion (energy)**, measured in million tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2e). Sourced from reliable datasets, this dataset sheds light on energy-related industrial contributions to climate change across countries and over decades.

## 🌍 Dataset Overview
- **Metric**: CO2 emissions from industrial combustion (Mt CO2e).
- **Source**: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) or relevant source.
- **Time Span**: Varies by country but spans several decades.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Worldwide.

## 📊 Key Questions to Explore
1. Which countries contribute the most to industrial CO2 emissions?
2. How have industrial CO2 emissions changed over time globally and regionally?
3. What factors correlate with high industrial emissions (e.g., GDP, energy use)?

## 🚀 Potential Applications
- **Climate Change Analysis**: Understand trends in CO2 emissions and their implications for global warming.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Analyze disparities in industrial emissions across countries.
- **Correlation Studies**: Study the relationship between emissions and economic or energy indicators.
